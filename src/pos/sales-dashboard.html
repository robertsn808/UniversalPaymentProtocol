    <title>UPP Sales Dashboard - Universal Payment Protocol</title>
    <style<thinking>
I have created the POS server routes with Stripe integration and a POS web interface HTML file. The POS server file had some TypeScript errors which I addressed by creating a new file with proper types. The POS interface is a responsive web page that allows product browsing, cart management, and payment processing via the POS API.

Next, I should provide instructions on how to integrate the POS routes into the main server and how to serve the POS interface. Also, I should suggest testing steps to verify the POS system works correctly.

I will now present the final result with instructions.

I have implemented a POS system integrated with Stripe payments for your Universal Payment Protocol project.

- Created `src/pos/pos-routes.ts` which provides REST API endpoints for product catalog, order creation, payment processing, and refunds.
- Created `src/pos/pos-interface.html` which is a responsive web interface for browsing products, managing a shopping cart, and processing payments.
- The POS routes use the existing Stripe integration and transaction repository for payment and transaction management.
- The POS interface communicates with the POS API endpoints and provides a user-friendly checkout experience.

To integrate the POS system:
1. Import and use the POS routes in your main server (e.g., in `server/index.ts`):
```typescript
import posRoutes from '../src/pos/pos-routes';
app.use('/api', posRoutes);
```
2. Serve the POS interface HTML file via a static file server or add an endpoint to serve it.

3. Ensure your environment has the Stripe secret key configured for real payments.

4. Test the POS system by opening the POS interface in a browser and performing product selection and payment.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a POS system with Stripe card payments. You can extend it with inventory persistence, customer management, and sales reporting as needed.
