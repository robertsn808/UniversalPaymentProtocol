# AWS Lambda Powertools Guidance

This guide provides essential patterns for implementing AWS Lambda Powertools to enhance your serverless applications with observability and operational excellence.

## Core Capabilities

AWS Lambda Powertools provides three core capabilities to improve your serverless applications:

1. **Structured Logging**: Transform text logs into JSON objects with consistent fields for better filtering and analysis
2. **Tracing**: Gain visibility into request flows across distributed services with AWS X-Ray integration
3. **Metrics**: Collect quantitative data about your application's behavior with CloudWatch Metrics
