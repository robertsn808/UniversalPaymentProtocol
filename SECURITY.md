   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration is managed through environment variables:

```bash
# Required for production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Optional security settings
NODE_ENV=production
CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100
```

### Security Headers
The application includes comprehensive security headers:

```typescript
// Security middleware configuration
helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true,
  },
});
```

## 🧪 Security Testing

### Automated Security Checks
Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**
   ```bash
   npm audit --audit-level moderate
   ```

2. **Custom Security Validation**
   ```bash
   npm run security:check
   ```

3. **Container Security Scanning**
   ```bash
   trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL
   ```

4. **Secrets Detection**
   ```bash
   trufflehog --only-verified
   ```

### Manual Security Testing
We recommend the following security testing:

1. **OWASP ZAP**: Web application security testing
2. **Burp Suite**: Manual security testing
3. **Nmap**: Network security scanning
4. **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing
